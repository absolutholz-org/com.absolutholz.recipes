    "notes": "Whatâ€™s the shelf life of hamburger seasoning? This recipe makes approximately 6 teaspoons of seasoning, which is enough for 2-3 pounds of beef. We often double the recipe and store any leftovers for future use. You can store any leftover seasoning in an air tight container for 6 months."
